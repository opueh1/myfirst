<h1 id="top">YL WILDLIFE</h1><hr />
<p> welcome to yl offficial webpage where we discuss about wildlife related issues and other related topics concerning wildlife.<br /> our main mission is to broadcast issues that are concerning wildlife and other related matters to viewers who are willing to protect wildlife and to gather donations to save near extincting species.We hope to raise awareness of the issues concerning wildlife especially in regions like asia and africa. In this homepage we only address a few animals so if you wish to learn more about other animals, you can tap the search icon to search for other animals and their corresponding topics.<br /><i><b> to learn more,you can go to the universal animal support page by clicking <a href="https://www.networkforanimals.org">here</a></b></i> </p>

<dd>Tortoises are terrestrial reptiles with large protective shells, known for their long lifespans and herbivorous diets, living on most continents in diverse habitats from deserts to forests. Major issues include habitat loss and fragmentation from human expansion, illegal wildlife trade for food, medicine, and pets, and negative impacts from introduced invasive species like rats and pigs. For pet tortoises, health issues like pyramiding (deformed shells due to improper hydration), metabolic bone disease (from poor diet and lack of UV light), and parasites are common, requiring proper humidity, a balanced diet, and appropriate housing.<br />
About Tortoises <br />
Habitat:
They are found worldwide, living in diverse environments such as arid deserts, grasslands, and tropical forests, but not in Australia or Antarctica.<br />
Anatomy:
Tortoises have large, bony shells that protect them from predators and injury. <br />
Diet:
Most are herbivores, eating plants, flowers, and fruits, though some may also eat animal matter.<br /> 
Lifespan:
They are among the longest-living land animals, with many species living for 80 to 150 years, some even exceeding 200 years. <br />
Behavior:
They are typically diurnal (active during the day), slow-moving, and prefer to be solitary. <br />

Pet Tortoise Health Issues <br />
Pyramiding:
A shell deformity where the scutes become stacked and pointed due to a lack of proper humidity and hydration. 
Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD):
Caused by an improper balance of calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D due to insufficient ultraviolet light or poor diet, leading to weakened bones and a misshapen shell. 
Parasites:
Internal parasites can cause lethargy, weight loss, and digestive issues. 
Respiratory Infections:
Can occur due to improper environmental conditions, such as low temperatures or excessive humidity.

<dt id="giraffe"> <b> GIRAFFE </b> </dt>

Giraffes face significant threats including habitat loss and fragmentation due to human expansion, poaching for their meat and parts, climate change leading to drought and food scarcity, civil unrest and lack of law enforcement, human-wildlife conflict, and slow reproduction rates which hinder population recovery. These interconnected issues have led to the endangerment of several giraffe subspecies across Africa.  
Habitat Loss and Fragmentation <br />
Human Population Growth:
Expanding human settlements and agriculture are converting giraffe habitats into farmland and urban areas, shrinking and dividing their living spaces.<br />
Resource Scarcity:
Fragmentation reduces access to essential food and water, making giraffes more vulnerable and leading to their confinement in smaller, isolated areas.
Poaching and Illegal Hunting<br /> 
Targeted for Parts:
Giraffes are hunted for their meat, hides, bones, hair, and tails, which contributes to population declines.<br />
International Trade:
A significant number of giraffe specimens, including live animals and their parts, are traded internationally, further impacting populations.
Climate Change and Ecological Changes<br />
<img src="ylimages/giraffes.jpg" alt="a pair of giraffe couples" title ="a pair of giraffes" height="350" width="400"/>
Drought:
Rising global temperatures cause prolonged droughts, leading to severe water scarcity and widespread food shortages for giraffes. <br />
Disease:
Habitat fragmentation can also increase the spread of disease, as it can lead to higher rates of inbreeding, making giraffes more susceptible. 
Human-Wildlife Conflict <br />
Search for Resources: As giraffes search for water and food due to climate-induced scarcity, they often venture into human-populated areas, leading to dangerous encounters with people.
Slow Reproduction<br />
Low Birth Rates:
Giraffes have a lengthy 15-month gestation period and typically give birth to a single calf. <br />
Limited Calf Survival:
With only about five to six calves born in a lifetime and only half likely to reach adulthood, it takes a long time for populations to recover from losses <hr /></dd>

<dd> Lion-related issues include their declining wild populations, largely due to human activities like habitat loss from human encroachment, human-wildlife conflict resulting in retaliatory killings, poaching for body parts and the illegal wildlife trade, and climate change affecting prey availability. Issues in captive lions involve poor husbandry, welfare concerns for captive-bred cubs, and health problems such as diseases and malnutrition.  
Issues Facing Wild Lions<br />
Human-wildlife conflict:
Lions attack livestock, leading to retaliation by farmers who kill lions. <br />
Poaching and illegal wildlife trade:
Lions are poached for their bones, skin, teeth, and claws, which are used in traditional medicine and the illegal wildlife trade. <br />
Habitat loss:
Human populations are expanding into lion habitats, fragmenting populations and increasing contact. <br />
Prey decline:
A scarcity of natural prey due to factors like the bushmeat trade and climate change forces lions to prey on livestock, intensifying human-lion conflict. <br />
Climate change:
Extreme weather and droughts impact prey populations, affecting lion food sources. <br />
<img src="ylimages/lions.jpg" alt="a couple of lions" title="a courtship of lions" height="350" width="400"/>
Trophy and canned hunting:
Lions are sometimes killed for trophies, or in "canned hunting," where they are hunted in confined spaces. <br />
Disease outbreaks:
Outbreaks of viruses like canine distemper virus (CDV) can significantly impact wild lion populations. 
Issues Facing Captive Lions <br />
Poor husbandry:
In captivity, especially at breeding facilities, practices like inadequate care, poor breeding practices, and lack of trained caregivers contribute to significant welfare problems.<br />
Stress and negative behaviors:
Stress, aggression, and other negative behaviors are common among captive lions, partly due to the nature of activities like cub-petting.<br />
Health problems:
Captive lions are susceptible to various health issues, including malnutrition, diseases, and injuries.<br />
Lack of research:
There is a general lack of scientific research focused on the welfare of captive lions, particularly those at commercial breeding farms.<br /> <hr /> </dd>

Zebra-related issues fall into two main categories: wild zebra threats like habitat loss, hunting, disease, and climate change, leading to several species being endangered or vulnerable. The other category involves Zebra thermal printer issues, which are common and include paper jams, poor print quality, connectivity problems, calibration errors, and incorrect media loading.<br />
Issues for Wild Zebras<br />
Habitat Loss:
As human populations expand, zebra habitats are destroyed or fragmented for other uses, reducing the available grazing land. <br />
Hunting:
Illegal hunting and poaching for various purposes continue to be a major threat to zebra populations. <br />
Disease:
Like other wild animals, zebras are susceptible to various diseases that can impact their survival. <br />
Climate Change:
Increased droughts and extreme weather conditions linked to climate change diminish the grass zebras need, affecting their food and water sources. <br />
Natural Predators:
Lions, hyenas, and wild dogs prey on zebras, but the threats posed by human activities are generally more significant.<br />
Vulnerable Populations:
Many zebra species, such as Grevy's zebra and the mountain zebras, are listed as endangered or vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, facing a serious risk of extinction.<br /> </dd>
